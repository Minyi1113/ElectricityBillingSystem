# Electricity Billing System
Electricity Billing System is a java project report is a critical function of the Electricity billing. Even though it looks simple it is far from simple and involves processes that can give various problems. Most problems, currently seen, result from the manual processes followed. Calculation errors, delays in system updating and fault tracking issues are the major problem are difficult to find to answer. So this paper suggests a billing based system to collect, process and notify accurate to suit the requirements for customers.

# Vision
Our project entitled "Electricity Billing System" aims is to generate electricity bill with all the charges and penalty. The Manual system that is employed is extremely laborious and quite inadequate. It only makes the process more difficult and hard. The aim of our project is to develop a system that is meant to partially computerize the work performed in the Electricity Board like generating monthly electricity bill, store record of the customer and previous unpaid record.


# How to Install
This is a Desktop Java application without installation. It can run on Windows and Linux GUI platform directory.

Second once you donwload the app is easy to manage electric billing problem, user can use the system to review their monthly payment
and make payment through the system.
Moreover, most billing system will requier transcation fee, but using our application won't cause any fee.

Weiying Wang:

I have three tasks which will finish in three weeks, respectively.  
The first task is the management page form. This form contains clients’ names and relative information, including customer billing information. I need to create two tables so that information is clear when a customer clicked their name. The second task is ABOUT page form, this page will introduce the application simply by a couple of paragraphs. I’ll also design a logo for our billing system and put it in our ABOUT form. The third task is System Function Design, this is documentation to describe all the functions implemented in our billing system. And I’ll introduce how is every function works well. 

Yangmiao Wu:

For this project, I will be responsible for the login registration page(Login Signup form) and billing details page(Bill Details form). The login registration page allows customers to log in using their username and password to enter the account or create a new account if they are a new user. The billing details page allows customers to view their bill details for the current month. I'll pick up more tasks when we getting deep into the project.
